IV.1 Membership Fee

The Society shall levy a membership fee to either be collected by the University as a portion of
student fees, or paid directly to the Society. Some members are exempt from having to pay the
membership fee, as defined elsewhere in this document.

The amount of the MathSoc Fee may be adjusted only through one of the following two mechanisms:

1. Once per Fall term, by a resolution of Council, specifying an adjustment of a percentage equal
to or less than the increase in the Consumer Price Index for Canada in the previous calendar year
according to Statistics Canada. This increase is subject to ratification at the next General Meeting; or
2. Modified or removed by a referendum held in accordance with these bylaws.

If a student has arranged fee payment to the satisfaction of the University and the arranged
fees include the fee for a given term, then that student is considered to have paid the fee for that
term, regardless of whether or not the Society has received the funds.

Members of the Society have the right to request a fee refund within any procedures set out
by a decision of the Society. If they are not exempt from paying the membership fee, then upon
submitting a refund request, their rights as members cease, but they are entitled to receive the
refund only if they have not in the interim used any services of the Society.
