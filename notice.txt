V.5 Notice & Agenda

Notice must be provided at least 48 hours in advance of any meeting to every voting member of
Council unless that member explicitly waives their right to notice before the start of the meeting.
The complete agenda, including the full text of any motions for which notice is required, shall
be made available publicly no less than 48 hours in advance of any meeting.
Where notice is required of a motion, notice of that motion must be provided at least seven
days in advance of the meeting at which the motion is to be considered to every voting member of
Council unless that member explicitly waives their right to notice before the start of the meeting
at which the motion is moved. A full description of the intended motion, such as the text of a
proposed amendment or agreement, must be provided, but the motion may be amended before or
after it is moved as long as the changes remain within the scope of the motion for which notice was
given.
Council may designate a mailing list or similar forum to be the official notice forum of Council;
if this is done, then any notice sent to that forum is considered to have been sent to every voting
member of Council regardless of whether or not it was received by that member
